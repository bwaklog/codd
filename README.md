# Codd

**motivation**

Named after EF Codd after the paper [A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf). The current project is just a single file experiment trying to get relational algebra to work. There are no optimisations.

I do have plans to build upon this for a toy database implementation.

- [erikgrinaker/toydb](https://github.com/erikgrinaker/toydb) was a good reference especially from the AST to Executor phase for schema creation
